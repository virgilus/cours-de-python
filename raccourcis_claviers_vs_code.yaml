## Classic but we might need to tweak them:
Go to the Explorer:
  - shortcut: ctrl + shift + e
  - tweak: On Linux, it might not work. In that case check ibus-setup in the terminal and remove shortcut associated to emoji.
Select the entire line:
  - shortcut: ctrl + l
  - tweak: For ipynb, first go to shortcuts and remove the ctrl + l associated with notebook.centerActiveCell

# Virgile's custom Jupyter Notebooks shortcuts (You need to go to the shortcut menu and add them manually)

Restart kernel and run all above selected cell : ctrl + maj + 0
Interrupt Kernel: ctrl + i ctrl + i

###### (Inserting a line below or above is usually ctrl + enter and ctrl + shift + enter.)
###### (But this doesn't work with ipynb, so I changed it to "ctrl + *", because it's a key which is next to the "enter" key.)
Inserting a line below: ctrl + *
Inserting a line above: ctrl + maj + *
